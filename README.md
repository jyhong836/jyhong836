### Hi there, I'm [Junyuan Hong](https://jyhong.gitlab.io/) ðŸ‘‹

I am a researcher on Machine Learning. My research centers around *Privacy-Centric Trustworthy Machine Learning*. My vision is to enhance trustworthiness (regarding fairness, robustness and security) under the privacy constraint, e.g., federated learning and differentially-private learning. My research highlights:
* [**Privacy**] in centralized learning with [theoretic understanding](https://jyhong.gitlab.io/publication/ondynamic) and [empirical algorithms](https://jyhong.gitlab.io/publication/learn2protect) and in [distributed learning](https://github.com/illidanlab/HyFL).
* [**Trustworthiness**] â¨‰ Privacy: Federated Learning and Private Edge-Cloud Collaboration.
  * **Fair** [pre-training](https://jyhong.gitlab.io/publication/faircl2022) and [federated learning](https://github.com/illidanlab/FADE):open_file_folder:.
  * **Robustness** by efficient acquisition against [adversarial samples](https://github.com/illidanlab/FedRBN):open_file_folder: and [OoD inference](https://github.com/illidanlab/FOSTER):open_file_folder:.
  * **Secure** learning against backdoor attacks in [private-data-free distillation](https://jyhong.gitlab.io/publication/datafree_backdoor2023icml).
  * **Inclusive** learning by efficient [on-device model adaptation](https://github.com/SonyResearch/MECTA):open_file_folder:, and [private outsourcing training](https://jyhong.gitlab.io/publication/ecos) and [customizable federated learning](https://github.com/illidanlab/SplitMix):open_file_folder: for low-end devices.
